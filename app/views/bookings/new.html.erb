In order to cancel under the policy, you will be required to attest to the facts of and/or provide supporting documentation for your extenuating circumstance.

The Hostâ€™s cancellation policy will apply as usual to reservations made after 14 March 2020, except where a guest or Host is sick with COVID-19.
